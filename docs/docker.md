# Docker Guide

This document explains how to build, run, and manage the Food Delivery Management System using Docker and Docker Compose.

---

# Overview

The project supports two Docker deployment modes:

1. **Shared Infrastructure (Recommended)**
2. **Standalone Docker**

The recommended approach uses a separate infrastructure repository that provides shared MySQL and Redis containers for multiple projects. The standalone option runs everything directly from this repository.

---

# Docker Architecture

## Shared Infrastructure

```
                    +----------------------+
                    |   FastAPI Backend    |
                    +----------+-----------+
                               |
                               |
                    +----------v-----------+
                    |   Shared MySQL       |
                    +----------------------+
                               |
                    +----------v-----------+
                    |   Shared Redis       |
                    +----------------------+
```

This setup allows multiple projects to share the same infrastructure while keeping each application isolated.

---

## Standalone Deployment

```
+------------------------------+
| Delivery        System       |
|------------------------------|
| Backend                      |
| Frontend                     |
| MySQL                        |
| Redis                        |
+------------------------------+
```

Recommended for open source users or isolated development environments.

Services started:

* FastAPI
* MySQL
* Redis

Everything runs inside Docker Compose.

```text
           Docker Compose
                  │
     ┌────────────┼────────────┐
     │            │            │
 FastAPI       MySQL        Redis
```


Everything runs from a single repository using Docker Compose.

---

# Shared Infrastructure (Recommended)

This workflow uses the separate **docker-infra** repository to provide common infrastructure for multiple applications.

## Advantages

- Shared MySQL instance
- Shared Redis instance
- Reduced resource usage
- Easier management across projects
- Cleaner separation between infrastructure and application code


Services are provided externally:

* MySQL
* Redis

Only the application container is started by this repository.

```text
Application Container
        │
        ├──────────────► Shared MySQL
        │
        └──────────────► Shared Redis
```

# Start Infrastructure

```bash
cd docker-infra

docker compose up -d
```

Once the infrastructure is running, start the application:

```bash
cd Delivery-System/

docker compose up --build
```

The application automatically connects to the shared containers.

---

# Standalone Docker

If you don't want to use the shared infrastructure repository, the project can run independently.

Start everything using:


```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.oss.yml up --build
```

This starts:

- FastAPI backend
- MySQL
- Redis

No external repositories are required.

---

# Docker Compose Files

## docker-compose.yml

Uses the shared infrastructure.

Services include:

- Backend
- Frontend

External services:

- Shared MySQL
- Shared Redis

---

## docker-compose.oss.yml

Runs a completely self-contained environment.

Services include:

- Backend
- Frontend
- MySQL
- Redis

Suitable for:

- Open-source users
- Local development
- Portfolio demonstrations

# Project Structure


| File                   | Purpose                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| docker-compose.yml     | Uses shared infrastructure     |
| docker-compose.oss.yml | Complete standalone deployment |
| docker/                | Dockerfiles                    |
| backend/               | Backend source code            |

---

# Environment Configuration

The application selects the correct infrastructure based on environment variables.

## Shared Infrastructure

```
ENV=docker

DB_HOST=shared-mysql
REDIS_HOST=shared-redis
```

---

## Standalone

```
ENV=docker

DB_HOST=mysql
REDIS_HOST=redis
```

---

# Starting the Project

## Shared Infrastructure

Start infrastructure:

```bash
cd docker-infra

docker compose up -d
```

Start the application:

```bash
cd Delivery-System/

docker compose up --build
```

---

## Standalone

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.oss.yml up --build
```

---

# Stopping Containers

## Shared Infrastructure

Application only:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Infrastructure:

```bash
cd docker-infra

docker compose down
```

---

## Standalone

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.oss.yml down
```

---

# Reset Database

## Shared Infrastructure

```bash
cd docker-infra

docker compose down -v
```

This removes:

- Shared MySQL data
- Shared Redis data

> **Warning:** This affects every project using the shared infrastructure.

---

## Standalone

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.oss.yml down -v
```

This removes only this project's database and Redis volumes.

---

# Docker Images

The project includes Dockerfiles for:

- FastAPI backend

These images are used for:

- Local development
- Production deployments
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- VPS deployments

# Networking

Docker Compose creates an isolated bridge network for service communication.

```text
                 Docker Network
                       │
       ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
       │               │               │
   FastAPI          MySQL          Redis
```

Container communication uses service names instead of IP addresses.

Example:

```env
DB_HOST=mysql

REDIS_HOST=redis
```

---

# Volumes

Persistent Docker volumes are used to retain database data.

Example:

```text
mysql_data
```

Benefits:

* Data survives container recreation
* Easy backups
* Improved reliability

# Best Practices

- Use the shared infrastructure for active development.
- Use the standalone configuration for open-source users.
- Keep secrets in environment variables.
- Avoid modifying Dockerfiles unless necessary.
- Rebuild containers after dependency changes.
- Use Docker volumes to persist MySQL data.
